# My arch dotfiles
Here is my configuration for neovim, zsh (oh-my-zsh), X Keyboard Extension, termite terminal and i3wm.
## Structure
* Mine scripts are in `~/bin/`.
* I have split conifugration for zsh, i3 and neovim: all aliases and functions for zsh are in `~/.zshrc.d/` directory. i3 config is compiled into one file with a handwritten script in `~/bin/`.
## How do I manage them?
I use and highly recommend [yadm](https://thelocehiliosan.github.io/yadm/) - it is `git` optimized for `~`, to use it just substitute `git` to `yadm` in whatever command you want to run.
